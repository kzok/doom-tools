# (WIP) doom-tools

tools to develop wads for Doom(1993) just for my personal use.
:warning: currently *work-in-progress* and nothing will work.

## :mountain: overview

### wad-viewer

https://kzok.github.io/doom-tools/wad-viewer/

Like [SLADE](https://slade.mancubus.net/), you can see content in your Doom WAD Archive.

## :computer: for developer

Please use `Makefile` served as a task runner.

```bash
make
```
