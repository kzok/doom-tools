# components/

## overview

This folder aims to serve UI components.
The component system is built from scratch because this is just my personal project and just for fun.

Foundation (especially user action) components tend to adapt flat design referring the following major design systems, but not always.

* [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/)
* [Fluent Design](https://fluent2.microsoft.design/)

## guidelines

In this foler, ...

* `css-modules` is used to style components.
* `storybook` is used to provide component catalogue.
* `vitest` is used to test.
